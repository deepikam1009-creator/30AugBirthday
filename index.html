I tried to sleep, I really did,
But thoughts of you would not stay hide forever.
The night is  long, the silent air sound is all I hear but I was fail to sleep. Because of the noons laughs we had and starry eyes you had me got me no sleep
Not exaggerating but today is a full moon day where the 
The moon peeked in
Was it just me who felt that spark 
Or did it catch in both our hearts?
I wondered if you felt it too
A sleepless night, yet sweet and light
The cost of such a perfect night.💖</p>

  <h2>My Letter to You 💌</h2>
  <p>
    I was thinking from long enough to be able to answer this, such a small question:
    <em>“Why you choose me over everyone?”</em> but yet a complex emotion it carries.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be honest, I don’t really! Because it’s none of this ever matter when I am able 
    to provide you the love you deserve and the happiness you craved for the most. 
    I know you’re so exhausted while sharing fun with everyone, but deep down you’re 
    losing the real you — which I realised in this short time.
  </p>
  <p>
    You deserve to be adored and cared for in every way that your mind, body, and heart 
    needs and longs for. You deserve to be appreciated in every way you give your love 
    and energy to someone else. You deserve to be taken on extravagant dates, to not 
    feel guilty asking for what you want, to be unapologetically you. To put your foot 
    down and say no more when someone is only willing to give you the bare minimum. 
    You deserve to keep your standards high, because that means you will not allow 
    yourself to settle.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also want to make sure that you feel safe, loved and comforted. I want you to know 
    that you can come to me when you're not okay, when your eyes are filled with tears, 
    and I'll hold you till you're a little more okay. I'm always here for you. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I know there are many people around you who might help you, but there is also me 
    who will be happy even if you’re doing great with or without me — I just need you 
    to be happy, my pretty lady 😙
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not leaving, I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying right here with you. Everything 
    is going to be okay. We are going to be okay. This will last as long as we choose 
    each other and keep choosing each other for the rest of our lives. And I have no 
    doubt in my mind that we will. 
                             <I> <h2> - Yours Abhi </h2></I>
